## <div align="center">3D Vehicle Model Design</div>

 - The vehicle chassis used in this competition is our in-house, self-developed design. The following will introduce the vehicle chassis design and production process.
 - We use Onshape to design the 3D model structure of the vehicle, and based on the chassis's characteristics, we manufacture the necessary vehicle parts using equipment such as laser cutting machines and 3D printers.

  - #### Onshape Introduction
    - We use Onshape to design 3D models of self-driving cars. Onshape is a free and easy-to-use web-based CAD software.
    - After creating a model in Onshape, you can output a 2D dimension drawing, which can then be sent to a laser-cutting machine for cutting or converted and sent to a 3D printer for output.
    - All 3D/2D vehicle models created for this competition were designed in OnShape.

- ### The Production of Vehicle Chassis Panels Introduction - Using a laser-cutting machine
  - A laser-cutting machine is a device that utilizes a laser beam to cut materials. The laser beam has high energy density and can cut a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, paper, and more, quickly and precisely.
  - We use the laser-Cutting machine provided by the school to produce the 'vehicle underfloor,' 'vehicle mid-deck,' and 'vehicle top deck' required for the vehicle chassis. We cut 3mm thick wooden boards according to the self-designed vehicle flat panel dimensions chart.  
  - We use lighter-weight wooden boards as the material for vehicle flat panels to reduce the vehicle's weight.  
  - Here is an introduction to the process of creating vehicle flat panels using a laser cutting machine.

- ### The Production of Vehicle Support Frames Introduction - Using a 3D Printer
    - 3D printing is a manufacturing technology that builds objects layer by layer using a digital model.
    - We chose to use a 3D printer to manufacture the vehicle body because, compared to commercially available LEGO, 3D printing offers the advantage of not being bound by original specifications, providing increased freedom and flexibility in design. In contrast to products cut with a laser cutting machine, 3D printed components eliminate assembly issues and offer advantages in terms of lightweight construction.
    - Here is an introduction to the process of producing vehicle support frames using a 3D printer.

     - The vehicle chassis produced using the 3D printer mentioned above was found to be prone to damage during collisions due to motor torque. As a result, we switched to using a Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer to manufacture the required support frames for the vehicle, ensuring that the same issue does not occur during the competition."


  - #### Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Printer 

    - The working principle of a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer is to project a UV light source onto a vat of liquid resin. The light cures the resin layer by layer until the entire object solidifies, known for its high precision and surface smoothness. They are typically used to manufacture highly precise and intricately structured objects.

    __Printing completed:__

      <div align="center"><img src="./img/成品.jpg" width=350 alt="3D" ></div>

    __Maintenance Process:__

    Without regular maintenance, a stereolithography 3D printer may become clogged with resin and become unusable, requiring periodic cleaning. So we recorded the cleaning methods we learned from our seniors and started cleaning ourselves.
      
    1. After the printing is complete, the finished product will be stuck to the build plate.
    2. Remove the build platform.
    3. Wipe off any resin adhering to the finished product.
    4. Clean the finished product with water.
    5. Spray alcohol to prevent an oily surface.
    6. Wipe off excess moisture and alcohol.
    7. Use a utility knife to remove the finished product from the platform.
    8. Remove any burrs from the finished product.
    9. Finally, clean the platform and restore the machine.

   - Because the photocured parts are somewhat soft, we need to expose them to ultraviolet (UV) light for secondary curing, making the parts harder and less susceptible to deformation, which could affect the vehicle's movement.
