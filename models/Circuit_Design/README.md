- 在設計自駕車電路時，我們先想好我們自駕車所需的功能，在繪製出電路圖，這樣做不僅讓我們有電路圖可以看，讓我們製作電路板較為方便，另一方面則可以避免線路出錯導致物件燒毀。
-  自駕車的電路板是我們使用電木萬用板依據我們設計好的電路圖焊接而成，不是購買設計好的成品。
- 電源及訊號是自駕車電路中必不可少的兩個部分。電源為電路提供電力，訊號則是傳輸數據。在電路板的四週設計插座方式，可以方便連接感測器或電池等設備，從而提高電路的靈活性和可擴展性。

- When designing the self-driving circuit, we first think about the functions required by our self-driving car, and then draw the circuit diagram. This not only allows us to have a circuit diagram to see, but also makes it more convenient for us to make circuit boards. On the other hand, it can avoid wiring An error caused the object to burn.
- The circuit board of the self-driving car is welded by using bakelite multi-purpose board according to the circuit diagram we designed, instead of purchasing the designed finished product.
- Power supply and signal are two essential parts of the self-driving circuit. The power supply provides power to the circuit, and the signal transmits data. Designing sockets around the circuit board can facilitate the connection of devices such as sensors or batteries, thereby improving the flexibility and scalability of the circuit.
